## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- Practiced using flexbox and looking at differences between using grid in creating the cards. 
- Learned how to add several breakpoints to create a responsive site. 
- Made sure to begin with mobile-design first so I could get used to it. 


### Continued development

Practicing when to use flexbox vs grid for layouts

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-columns) - The website helped me understand the concepts on grid template columns and whether or not to use them instead of flexbox. 
- [Resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_converter.asp) - A helpful tool from W3 that converts hsl values to hex.
